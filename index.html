Weâ€™ll be <br> looking at content order, site map, key user paths and<br> wireframes, and  then start tying these in - where applicable - <br> with the user stories being created for the technical delivery.</p>

        <p>Here we understand the overall business of the client, the objectives, the <br> strategies and the target audience. We<br> analyze the requirements of the client and come up with<br> path breaking ideas and solution. We also make a thorough<br> need analysis of the technology required. </p>

        <h2>The Process of Development</h2>
        <p>We approach programming in stages or iterations. Each <br>stage sets the pace for the subsequent iteration while<br> helping us to more carefully plan further work.<br>

          The storyboard is displayed on a corkboard to help our<br> manager to monitor development progress. This simple <br>process organization is a key to successful results.<br>
          
          We constantly assess our development pace by summing up <br>the number of completed tasks within each iteration. We <br>compose a list of tasks for the next iteration according to this<br> new data. Once we have the results of the iteration analysis,<br> we fine-tune and improve our performance for the next iteration. </p>

        <p>During this stage, we work closely with your team to ensure that the implementation is done smoothly. Integration with your system with its existing legacy is ensured. We believe this is the real beginning of our relationship with our clients. We know that being the first on the Net is not as important as delivering value consistently to our clients, customers. </p>

        <h2>Design of The design.</h2>
        <p>The first part of the design process<br> is to gain a solid understanding of<br>  the background of the project. We'll<br>  start with a discovery workshop<br>  and client survey learning about<br>  your business, your competitors,<br>  your future plans, and if its a new <br> business or product and youre <br> happy to share it, to review your <br> business plan. All these things<br>  mean when we start to define how<br>  we approach the design, that we<br>  have a real understanding of the<br>  background.</p>

        <h2>User Experience</h2>
        <p>Our design process is about so<br>  much more than just creating pretty<br>  pictures. It's about understanding<br>  and then delivering to<br>  requirements: both those of the<br>  business, and of the end-customer.<br>  Our thorough, proven design <br> methodology helps shape projects,<br>  and creates brilliant results. Take a<br>  look at some of our work here  we <br> love to share what we've been up<br>  to.</p>
